# Customer_Segmentation_Using_K-Means_CLustering

##Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of the online retail industry, utilizing a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes transactions made between 2010 and 2011. This project focuses on deriving customer insights through segmentation, aiming to optimize marketing efforts and improve overall sales.

##Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to transform raw transaction data into a customer-focused dataset by generating new features. These features will be used to segment customers into different groups using the K-means clustering algorithm. The customer segmentation will provide deeper insights into customer behaviors and preferences, enabling more effective, tailored marketing strategies.

##Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are outlined below:

###Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Clean the data by addressing missing values, handling duplicates, and removing outliers to ensure smooth clustering processes.
###Feature Engineering: Create new, relevant features from the existing data to shift the focus from transactional details to a customer-centric dataset for segmentation.
###Preprocessing & Scaling: Apply scaling and dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize the data for clustering algorithms.
###Customer Segmentation: Use the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their shopping patterns, supporting personalized marketing efforts.
###Cluster Profiling & Evaluation: Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment, and assess the effectiveness of the clusters for marketing initiatives.

##Dataset Information
The dataset consists of various fields related to online retail transactions. Below is a summary of key features:

###Variable	Description
###InvoiceNo	Unique identifier for each transaction. Codes beginning with 'c' signify a canceled transaction.
###StockCode	Unique code for each product.
###Description	Text description of the product.
###Quantity	Number of product units per transaction.
###InvoiceDate	Date and time when the transaction occurred.
###UnitPrice	Price of a single product unit, in British pounds.
###CustomerID	Unique identifier for each customer.
###Country	Country associated with the customer.
